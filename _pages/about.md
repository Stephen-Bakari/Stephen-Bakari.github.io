I am Stephen Jeuma Bakari, a scholar and professional in tourism management, cultural heritage, and regional development. I am currently pursuing a PhD in Tourism Management at Dongbei University of Finance and Economics in China, which I began in 2022 and expect to complete in 2025. Alongside my studies, I serve as an Assistant Lecturer at the University of Dodoma. In this position, I focus on research, teaching, and offering consultations in the fields of cultural heritage and tourism management, contributing to both academic knowledge and practical solutions in these areas.
