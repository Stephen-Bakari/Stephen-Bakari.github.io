I am Stephen Jeuma Bakari, a scholar and professional in tourism management, cultural heritage, and regional development. I am currently pursuing a PhD in Tourism Management at Dongbei University of Finance and Economics in China. Currently, I serve as an Assistant Lecturer at the University of Dodoma, focusing on research, teaching, and consultations in cultural heritage and tourism management.

Throughout my career, I have developed a deep interest in how tourism can empower communities and promote sustainable development. This passion is reflected in my publications, such as *"Tanzania’s Treasure: Community Empowerment through Sustainable Cultural Heritage Tourism,"* published in the *Technium Social Sciences Journal* (2024), and *"Cultural Heritage Tourism in Tanzania: A Systematic Literature Review"* on Preprints.org (2024). I have also examined domestic tourism challenges in my paper, *"Challenges Facing Domestic Tourism Promotion—A Case of Serengeti National Park, Tanzania,"* published in the *Journal of Tourism and Hospitality* (2021). In addition to these studies, I co-authored research on the impact of COVID-19 on global tourism and explored how motivation affects staff performance in Tanzanian microfinance institutions. 

My participation in conferences and international research efforts has further enriched my expertise. Notably, I presented my work, *"Cultural Space in Hospitality and Tourism: An Integrative Review and Future Study Direction,"* at the Faculty of Hospitality and Tourism Management, Macau University of Science and Technology. Through these experiences, I have honed my ability to engage in cross-cultural research and contribute to global tourism discourse. I work closely with mentors such as Professor Xiaoyun Zheng from Dongbei University and Dr. Mkubwa Shaali Ali from the University of Dodoma. With a focus on sustainable tourism and regional development, I aim to bridge academic research and practical solutions to foster meaningful social impact.
